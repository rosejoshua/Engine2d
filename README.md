# Engine2d

Hello! This is my first attempt at a 2d platformer engine from scratch using only SDL2 frameworks. It's already become obvious that the design as is will be quite limiting for my original idea for a game, so this is mostly an attempt to get something working and develop a list of requirements for a better future engine design. This version of engine will allow for fast-pased 2d, tile-based platforming (target refresh 165Hz), generated from level seeds using wave-function collapse. Also with score multipliers, coins, animated tiles, variable gravity with altitude change, trampolines, conveyer belts, ducking, sliding, dashing, slowed water physics, jumpjets, ice sliding, and enemies with chase AI.
