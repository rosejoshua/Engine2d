# Engine2d

Hello! This will be an amazing 2d game engine for my platformer game idea (Super Contra meets Super Meatboy meats[lulz] Smash TV meets Serious Sam...or something along those lines). For the gameplay mechanics, I would like overpowered blowback physics from weapons to allow for long fast jumps that can be continued (pogoed) for long distances with enough skill. Also, twin stick movement/aiming, enemy hoards, huge bosses, money system, mini-games (arcade and gambling), store weapons purchases, and permadeath after 3 lives. Oh and tons of easter eggs and nostalgia from the 90's. That's about all I've figured out for now.
