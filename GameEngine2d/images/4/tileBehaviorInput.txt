*** [true|false] HAS COLLISION: stops player velocity immediately when player contacts it ***
false
*** [true|false] DRAWS IN FRONT: draw after rendering player and over top...ex: transparent water, edges of clouds or treetops that can be stood on, etc. ***
false
*** [true|false] IS LETHAL: kills player with contact/collision ***
false
*** [true|false] HAS SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS: list true to access the properties listed after this one...so that we don't look at the following unless needed ***
false
*** [true|false] IS ANIMATED: uses a sequence of frames that get rotated thru no matter what ***
false
*** [true|false] IS CONSUMABLE: coins, hearts, powerups, etc...uses ***
true
*** [true|false] IS LIQUID: for applying alternate gravity when player is within tile ***
false
*** [true|false] HAS COLLISION ANIMATION: for things like springboards, item consumption animation, p-switches, etc ***
false
*** [true|false] HAS TRANSFORMATION: turns into different tile after some event calls transform() on the TextureTile ***
false
*** [0 to tileWidth] MINIMUM COLLISION RATIO: for items that are smaller than a tile, makes an approximation of where the player would touch the item, value is denominator of ratio of total tile pixels, 0 is dont use ***
0
*** [positive integer] TRANSFORMATION TILE INDEX: which TextureTile this will transform to after some event calls transform() on the TextureTile ***
1
*** [positive integer, 0 - 255] TRANSPARENCY ALPHA VALUE: 255 is solid, 0 is completely transparent ***
255
*** [positive integer] DESIRED MILLISECONDS BETWEEN ANIMATION FRAMES: number of milliseconds that must pass before the next animation frame is grabbed ***
